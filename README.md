# BabyInn website

The BabyInn Care Center Limited website has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and SQL for the back-end. The website is hosted on a web server and can be accessed through any web browser.

## Front-end Development

The front-end of the website has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the content of the website, CSS is used to style the website, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the website.

The project team has used modern front-end development frameworks such as Bootstrap and jQuery to make the website responsive and user-friendly.

## Back-end Development

The back-end of the website has been developed using SQL. The project team has used a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and manage data related to the services provided by BabyInn Care Center Limited.

The website uses SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data from the database. The project team has also implemented security measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in the database.
