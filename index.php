                Want a relaxing, comfortable, and worry-free confinement experience?
                Pregnancy in October is a great thing. The pain, blood and sweat during
                childbirth are unimaginable to ordinary people. Therefore, we understand
                how important confinement is to mothers. Only by receiving comprehensive
                and considerate care can we take care of the physical and mental health
                of all mothers. Postpartum is the weakest time for women. Confinement is
                very important. Confinement is like a reborn health. Some original
                ailments will heal without leaving traces. Postpartum confinement is a
                golden recovery period. Sloppy treatment.
